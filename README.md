2d Platformer that monsters evolve and adapt to survive.

<p>A small project where I wondered if I could possibly put together smaller images together to make a a whole image of something that looked okay graphically.I have put together this small project With the LIBGDX framework. I have several sheets of small parts that would go together that would assemble some kind of monster. Programatically, I had to point out within each object where pieces would go or where the "joint" would be (where two or more limbs would be attached). With that I also have a small library type class where you send it the number of the part you would want and it would send back the object that would contain all the information such as joint location, picture, width, height, etc.</p>
